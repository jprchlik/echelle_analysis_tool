      <h2 class="project-tagline">A GUI written in python (TkInter), which calculates equivalent widths (EWs) for echelle spectra. The tools works on all HIRES spectra reduced by MAKEE and spectra reduced via IRAF (i.e. makes assumptions about IRAF wavelength keywords). However, the GUI can do more than EWs. If you install MOOG and the MARCs model interpolater (and create aliases) you are able to perform a full spectral analysis (i.e. determine Teff, log g, metal content, and microturbulence). </h2>

<p>Anyone who has worked on stellar abundances knows that the field contains an abundance of useful but old software. The equivalent width (EW) measurement program SPECTRE is a fine example of such software. SPECTRE is the inspiration for the Echelle Analysis Tool (EAT). Following SPECTRE's lead, EAT allows you to visually analyze every EW you measure and remove or refit nonsensical measurements. However, unlike SPECTRE, EAT is dynamic. For example if you click the wrong location when defining a continuum in SPECTRA you must completely redefine the continuum, while in EAT you simply delete that point and continue with all previously selected continuum points. Additionally, EAT allows for 2-D spectra, so you may avoid the clunkiness of loading and unloading a spectrum (and line list) for every order.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the existing software does not communicate well. For example the output from SPECTRA cannot be directly read into MOOG, which a common program for determining stellar abundances. EAT fixes that problem by automatically generating a line list that MOOG can read. Furthermore, EAT can call MOOG directly and display MOOG information without ever leaving EAT. Therefore, you can iteratively solve for photospheric parameters and abundances from one program.</p>
