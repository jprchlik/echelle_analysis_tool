# echelle_analysis_tool
A GUI written in python (TkInter), which calculates equivalent widths (EWs) for echelle spectra.
The tools works on all HIRES spectra reduced by MAKEE and spectra reduced via IRAF (i.e. makes assumptions about IRAF wavelength keywords). 
However, the GUI can do more than EWs.
If you install MOOG and the MARCs model interpolater (and create aliases) you are able to perform a full spectral analysis (i.e. determine Teff, log g, metal content, and microturbulence).
